## Airbnb New User Bookings

#### Description

Airbnb is an online marketplace and hospitality service, enabling people to lease or rent short-term lodging including vacation rentals, apartment rentals, homestays, hostel beds, or hotel rooms. The company does not own any lodging; it is merely a broker and receives percentage service fees (commissions) from both guests and hosts in conjunction with every booking. It has over 3,000,000 lodging listings in 65,000 cities and 191 countries. In this project, we will predict the first destination of a new user based on the user's demographics and web session records.

Instead of waking to overlooked "Do not disturb" signs, Airbnb travelers find themselves rising with the birds in a whimsical treehouse, having their morning coffee on the deck of a houseboat, or cooking a shared regional breakfast with their hosts.

New users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 65,000+ cities across 190+ countries. By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand.

In this challenge, you are given a list of users along with their demographics, web session records, and some summary statistics. You are asked to predict which country a new user's first booking destination will be. All the users in this dataset are from the USA.

There are 12 possible outcomes of the destination country: 'US', 'FR', 'CA', 'GB', 'ES', 'IT', 'PT', 'NL' 'DE', 'AU', 'NDF' (no destination found), and 'other'. Please note that 'NDF' is different from 'other' because 'other' means there was a booking, but is to a country not included in the list, while 'NDF' means there wasn't a booking.
